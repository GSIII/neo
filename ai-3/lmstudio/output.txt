The meaning of life is a question that has puzzled philosophers and individuals for centuries. There isn't one definitive answer, as itâ€™s largely subjective and depends on individual beliefs and values. However, many find fulfillment in pursuing happiness, contributing to society, building meaningful relationships, experiencing beauty, and striving towards personal growth. Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.
